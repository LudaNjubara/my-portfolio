      'In my school days I tended to sit in the back of the class, away from the spotlights where all the "fun" was happening, and yet here I am as a frontend dev... I guess life really knows how to come full circle... Anyways, I digress. I like to spend my time learning and building projects. Some small some large, some make it to production some dont, but the important part of it all is figuring out those little tricks that arent exactly Google-able, like building my intuition and learning how to learn. Im a big fan of the "learn by doing" approach. I guess Im a big fan of learning in general haha. What Im also a big fan of is sharing what Ive learned, so I hope you find some value in my content as well.',
